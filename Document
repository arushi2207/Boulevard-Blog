# Introduction
## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements and design specifications for the development of a blog application using the MERN stack.

## Scope
The scope of the project includes the development of a full-featured blog application with user authentication, CRUD operations for blog posts, and a responsive user interface.

# Functional Requirements
## User Stories
User Authentication:

As a user, I should be able to register an account.
As a registered user, I should be able to log in and log out.
Blog Posts:

As a user, I should be able to create a new blog post.

As a user, I should be able to edit and delete my own comments.
## Database Schema
Define the MongoDB database schema for user accounts, blog posts, and comments.

javascript
Copy code
// User Schema
{
  username: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
}

// Blog Post Schema

  title: String,
  content: String,
  author: ObjectId(User),
  comments: [ObjectId(Comment)],
}

// Comment Schema
{
  content: String,
  author: ObjectId(User),
}
# Non-functional Requirements
